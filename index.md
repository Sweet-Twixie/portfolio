# Welcome to Yuliia Bykhovets Portfolio 👋

Hi! I’m Sweet-Twixie, and this is my personal Data Science portfolio.

# Projects

## [Football Player Position Prediction](project-football/index.html)

A project applying machine learning to predict which positions a football player can play based on their skills and attributes. Includes hierarchical multi-label classification, feature engineering, and data visualization. Built with **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

## [Persistent Homology on Breat Cancer histopathology image dataset](BreakHis-persistent-homology/index.html)

This project explores the use of **persistent homology** for **binary classification** of breast cancer histopathology images from the **BreakHis** dataset. The project demonstrates how topological data analysis (TDA) can capture global structural patterns in medical images and outperform classical handcrafted texture descriptors.
